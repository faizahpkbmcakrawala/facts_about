The life expectancy of cats has nearly doubled since 1930 - from 8 to 16 years.
The Maine Coon cat is America's only natural breed of domestic feline. It is 4 to 5 times larger than the Singapura, the smallest breed of cat.
In contrast to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during their domestication process.
